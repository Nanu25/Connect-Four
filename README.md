## About the Game

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs.

In this project, one player can compete against an AI opponent that uses the **Minimax algorithm** to play optimally.
